# Flow.ai API Documentation

[Documentation site](https://flow-ai.github.io/flowai-api-docs) for specifically the APIs and reference. Our docs are based on [Slate: API Documentation Generator](https://lord.github.io/slate)

## Get started

### Instalation

macOS comes prepackaged with both Ruby and RubyGems, however, some of the
Middleman's dependencies need to be compiled during installation and on macOS
that requires Xcode Command Line Tools. Xcode can be installed from the
terminal:

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

Once you have Ruby and RubyGems up and running, execute the following from the
command line:

```
$ gem install middleman
```

This will install Middleman, its dependencies and the command-line tools for
using Middleman.

### Running locally

1. Clone this repo
4. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Docker).

### Note on JavaScript Runtime

For those who don't have JavaScript runtime or are experiencing JavaScript runtime issues with ExecJS, it is recommended to add the [rubyracer gem](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer) to your gemfile and run `bundle` again.
